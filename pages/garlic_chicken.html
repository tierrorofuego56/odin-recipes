        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.</li>

            <i style="font-size: 15px">I did add a little more garlic and cut back on the pepper ( I can't eat much pepper) but otherwise did the recipe as is. Was great! You really need to try this recipe. Tasted absolutely delicious!! - June</i><br><br>

            <i style="font-size: 15px">So easy and so good. Made as wrote. As mentioned, by the OP use a tablespoon of garlic, not teaspoon. Will use this for chicken parmesan as well. -  Mihart</i><br><br>

            <i style="font-size: 15px">My wife and I really liked the recipe. Will be making it again. - Frank</i>
