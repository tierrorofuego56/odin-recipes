        <h1>Golden Cornbread</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: This sweet cornbread recipe starts with a cup of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Cornmeal: Opt for yellow cornmeal for this recipe, as it's sweeter than its white counterpart.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Use â…” cup white sugar for the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cornbread rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A teaspoon of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Milk: Use whole milk, 2% milk, or your favorite alternative milk to add moisture and help create the perfect batter consistency.</li>
            <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, keeps the cornbread nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Egg: One egg lends moisture and acts as a binding agent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add milk, vegetable oil, and egg; whisk until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
